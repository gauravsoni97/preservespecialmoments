# Bug Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Magnifier Functionality
**Problem**: The magnifier was not working properly and was showing a scaled version of the image.
**Solution**: 
- Added boundary checking to ensure the magnifier only appears when the mouse is within the image bounds
- Improved the zoom position calculation for better magnification effect
- Fixed the magnifier positioning to be more accurate

### 2. Cart State Synchronization
**Problem**: When a product was added to cart from the home page, the product detail page still showed "Add to Cart" instead of "Added to Cart".
**Solution**:
- Removed the local `addedToCart` state from ProductDetailPage
- Implemented a check using the global cart state to determine if a product is already in the cart
- Used `cart.some(item => item.id === product?.id)` to check if the product exists in the cart

### 3. Alert Removal
**Problem**: Alerts were showing when products were added to cart.
**Solution**: 
- Removed all `alert()` calls from the addToCart functions
- Replaced with silent state updates for better user experience

### 4. Consistent UI States
**Problem**: Inconsistent "Add to Cart" vs "Added to Cart" states between home page and product detail page.
**Solution**:
- Both home page and product detail page now use the same cart state to determine button text and styling
- Unified the logic for checking if a product is in the cart

## Files Modified

### `src/components/ProductDetailPage.tsx`
1. **Magnifier Enhancement**:
   - Added boundary checking in `handleMouseMove` function
   - Improved zoom position calculation

2. **Cart State Synchronization**:
   - Removed local `addedToCart` state
   - Added `isProductInCart` computed property that checks the global cart state
   - Updated Add to Cart button to use `isProductInCart` instead of local state

3. **Alert Removal**:
   - Removed `alert()` call from `addToCart` function

4. **UI Consistency**:
   - Updated button styling to match the home page implementation

### `src/App.tsx`
1. **Cart State Synchronization**:
   - Updated the Add to Cart button in the product grid to use `cart.some(item => item.id === product.id)` for checking if product is in cart
   - Removed dependency on local `addedToCart` state for button text and styling

## Technical Implementation Details

### Magnifier Fix
```typescript
const handleMouseMove = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
  if (!imageRef.current) return;
  
  const rect = imageRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();
  const x = e.clientX - rect.left;
  const y = e.clientY - rect.top;
  
  // Only show magnifier if mouse is within the image bounds
  if (x >= 0 && x <= rect.width && y >= 0 && y <= rect.height) {
    setMagnifierPosition({ x, y });
    
    // Calculate zoom position (inverted for magnifying effect)
    const zoomX = (x / rect.width) * 100;
    const zoomY = (y / rect.height) * 100;
    setZoomPosition({ x: zoomX, y: zoomY });
  }
};
```

### Cart State Synchronization
```typescript
// In ProductDetailPage
const isProductInCart = cart.some(item => item.id === product?.id);

// In Add to Cart button
<button
  className={`${
    isProductInCart
      ? 'bg-green-500 text-white cursor-default'
      : 'bg-gradient-to-r from-pink-500 to-rose-500 text-white hover:from-pink-600 hover:to-rose-600'
  }`}
  disabled={isProductInCart}
>
  {isProductInCart ? 'Added to Cart' : 'Add to Cart'}
</button>
```

## How to Test the Fixes

1. **Magnifier Functionality**:
   - Navigate to any product detail page
   - Hover over the main product image
   - The magnifier should appear and show a zoomed view of the image
   - Moving the mouse should move the magnifier smoothly
   - The magnifier should disappear when moving mouse outside the image

2. **Cart State Synchronization**:
   - Go to the home page
   - Add a product to cart (button should change to "Added to Cart")
   - Click on the same product to view its details
   - The Add to Cart button on the product detail page should show "Added to Cart"
   - Try adding the same product from different pages - state should be consistent

3. **Alert Removal**:
   - Add products to cart from both home page and product detail page
   - No alerts should appear
   - Products should be added silently to the cart

4. **UI Consistency**:
   - All Add to Cart buttons should have consistent styling
   - Disabled buttons should have the same appearance across the site
   - Button text should be consistent based on cart state

## Additional Improvements

1. **Performance**: Removed unnecessary local state management
2. **User Experience**: Eliminated disruptive alerts
3. **Consistency**: Unified cart state management across components
4. **Reliability**: Used global state instead of local state for cart status
